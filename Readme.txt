For this code, I use python 2.7.


Run:

python AsyModel.py

Result:

It will automatically generate a csv file which include the accuracy result for the stream dataset. The example is run for synRBF@002-2 dataset with parameters: alpha = 0.05, Ensemble size = 3, window size = 1000, here we set the source stream and target stream have the same window size.
